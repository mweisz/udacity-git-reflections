What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a hidden directory (.git) which contains all the metadata used for managing my repository.
I need to do this, to tell git, that this is a folder I want use version control in to differentiate it from 
a "normal" folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds the files I want to include into my next commit.
For example if I changed 3 files and I only want to commit the changes to 2 of them, I would add only those two
and the commit would not include the third file. 
However, the file is still present in my working directory.  The changes of that third file will not be commited to the repository.
