When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* When I want to work collaboratively with other people.
* When I simply want to share my repo with others. 
* To have an additional backup in case my hdd/ssd crashes... ;-)
* To sync my repo across multiple devices I own.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It basically comes down to similar reasons that why I might want to manually commit instead of having the system automatically "save" for me periodically.
It gives me the flexibility to decide when I actually need the newest version or when I should be pushing it ("Is it ready to be shared with others?"). If I accidentally make a mistake and commit it, I can commit a fix before sharing it with others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: I find an interesting repo on Github that I'd like to work on, but I don't have direct writing access to it (or don't to change the original one). Instead I fork it into my own Github account and can work on it as it pleases me. The owner of the forked repo is notified that her repo has been forked.

Clones: I can clone a remote repo (for example from Github) into my own local filesystem. Now I can locally edit or use it. If I want to apply my local changes to the remote repo I can simply push to it. Btw, I can also create a clone from a local repo if I feel like it.

Branches: While working inside my repo it might be useful to create a new branch for experimental features or different variations. Later I can merge the branches if I feel like it.
