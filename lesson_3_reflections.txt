When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* When I want to work collaboratively with other people.
* When I simply want to share my repo with others. 
* To have an additional backup in case my hdd/ssd crashes... ;-)
* To sync my repo across multiple devices I own.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It basically comes down to similar reasons that why I might want to manually commit instead of having the system automatically "save" for me periodically.
It gives me the flexibility to decide when I actually need the newest version or when I should be pushing it ("Is it ready to be shared with others?"). If I accidentally make a mistake and commit it, I can commit a fix before sharing it with others.
