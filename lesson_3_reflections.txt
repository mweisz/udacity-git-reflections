When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* When I want to work collaboratively with other people.
* When I simply want to share my repo with others. 
* To have an additional backup in case my hdd/ssd crashes... ;-)
* To sync my repo across multiple devices I own.
